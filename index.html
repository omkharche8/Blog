                refining my code proficinecy skills. <br> I don't even have a leetcode account yet and i am here doing

            <h4>More Work Less Time Good, Less Work More Time Bad</h4>
            <p>I technically only have 3 modules to do, others i need not learn anything new, but still the
                procastination is decently high.<br> Gotta start my work now. Edit: My Exam was amazing lets see how the
                results go now</p>

            <h4>Summer is in!</h4>
            <p>So I am home now and I got all days to myself, especially doing python. No idea but it just feels too good to practice the language itself. No Jazz just be proficient in doing the same thing. <br> Moreover would like to start a streak on going to gym/involved in physical activity for 40 days straight. Pretty Much possible.<br>Making a navbar at the top to put summer specials tho!
            Working on it simultaneously.</p>

            <h4>Picking up pacee</h4>
            <p>As i go down the summer vacations, trying to do 3 to 4 new array type questions on my <a href="https://github.com/omkharche8/Python">github repo </a> and one on my leetcode profile. I just need to keep on doing progress daily that's the point. <br>
            Personal front its going amazing, I'm able to talk to my already existing friends better(ðŸ˜‰) and efficiently.<br>
            Was thinking on starting a developmental project, will do in June tho!</p>

            <h4>Learning to Dance</h4>
            <p>Yo I have a wedding coming up (My Sisters) in exactly a month from now. So everyone here is going to dance. Even I'm in it!. <br> Learning to Dance is like the most different to learn skill for me. As i have never danced after 6th Grade (Stage Performance) getting those moves out my body is lil time taking but gotta do it. <br> Dance just makes you happy what i observed from practice and makes you feel good about yourself. I liked it, I will rock the dance floor hehehehe.</p>

            <h4>WTF is wrong with me???!!!!</h4>
            <p>Bruh this is the 4th time i'm seeing my GPA and feeling what do i even lack in life. <br> This time i have got 8.5 credits of C grade all super unexpected!!. By 1 mark lost them!!!. DBMS lost A by 2 marks and Sensors by 3 marks and all were because of DAs. <br> I still have no idea what is happening with my life here. Whatever i do i just can't help it. The CGPA still lies at 8.20 which increased by 0.01 this time. I mean *sarcastic laugh* I have nothing to say.</p>
            <p>Today morning the pain was a lot man, it was legit equivalent to something like a heartbreak. The body just pauses and implodes. I hope i recover from this, gotta do something.</p>
